# Operatos & Loops:

Operators are used to make decisions inside my code.  This can be as simple as "if-then" statements.  These decisions can be useful to tell the code to run a specific line once a condition is met.  

## Conditional Statements:

There are two components to a decision:
1. An expression is evaluated, which returns a value (if/then statements)
2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation (pg. 150)

>Some operators are:

    > == Is equal to
    > != Is not equal to
    > === Strict equal to
    > !== Strict not equal to
    > > Greater than
    > < Less Than
    > >= Greater than or equal to
    > <= Less than or equal to

## Logical Operators:

Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false.  Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.  For example: The && operator will compare two expressions to check if they are true or false then return true only if BOTH are true.  

>Some Logical Operators are:

    > &&  If both are true then TRUE
    > ||  Logical or (At least one condition)
    ! Logical Not
