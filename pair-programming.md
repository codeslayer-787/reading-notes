# Pair Programming

## What is it?

- 2 people dedicated to the same outcome, theres a driver (writing the code) and a navigator (who keeps the driver in check.)
  - Navigator - we need a function that sums 2 values
  - Driver - function (param1, param2){}
  - Navigator - name the parameters num1, and num2

## Why?

- Separating the responsibilities of each programmers makes us more efficient.

## How?

- The driver will fork the navigator's project repo on github, and clone it down and do work on it.
- A fork is an exact copy of someone else's repository, but under your github account.
- After work is completed, you make a pull request to merge the code that you worked on together back into the original person's (navigator's) repo.
