# HTML Lessons Learned

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  It adds data/content to a website.  While I can work using the same console and tools such as VS Code for both Git and HTML, these are two different things. HTML has lots of brackets to organize and categorize the data.  

**Always use index.html to create your main page!**

**Do not use Github to create anything other than repositories!**

## Before Starting to Create an HTML Website:

* Make sure you know the purpose of the website
* Know your client
* Know your audience
* Create a wireframe of the website
* Make sure your design helps communicate your message

## The Language:

* HTML utilizes brackets "(tags)"
* Tags are like containers and will communicate things about the information inside
* Each tag will have an open and a closing
* Some tags utilized today include:
  * html
  * body
  * h1 or h2, etc.
  * p
  * li
  * ul
  * nav
  * main
  * img
* The main parts so far learned are head, header, body, and footer.  We can also add articles that act like containers.  These can be stand alone or nested.  

## Layout:

Use the wireframe that I've created and add the code to make it happen!  To suscessfully create a layout I should use dividers "div".  

***placeholder websites are very useful if I'm not sure about what image to use at the moment.***
