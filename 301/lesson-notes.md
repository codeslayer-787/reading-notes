## forEach:

It's a function that calls callback functions once for each element.

## Pair Programming:

Pair programming works on the principle that "two heads are better than one".  Two developers can work on the same project and eliminate a lot of the headaches of doing all of the work by yourself.  There are two roles:

**The navigator** - This person does not touch the code.  They are there to guide the driver and think of the big picture.  They can do other tasks as managing version control and such.

**The driver** - This person will be the one typing the code.  They are responsible for the mechanics of the code itself and follows the instructions given by the navigator.

Some of the advantages of pair programming are:

1. Greater efficiency
1. Engaged collaboration
1. Learning from fellow students
1. Improving social skills
1. Job interview readiness
1. Work environment readiness

## HEROKU

Heroku is a container-based cloud service we can use to deploy and manage our apps.  It supports Java, Node.js, Python among others.  Our applications will have a unique domain to route HTTP requests to teh correct app container (dyno).  Heroku seems to be able to run the apps from the cloud reliably.  Today, we installed Heroku via shell commands.  For Windows (at least my machine) I had to run the .exe file provided in the page, then run the rest of the commands through the shell.  The service is free, but still asks for a credit card for incidentals due to too much use.  Somehow, I find HEROKU to be similar to Postgress, but with more features (so it appears.)
