# How Computers Work

### Computers "think" the following way:

- They receive an input (This can be through a keyboard, mouse, controller, voice, etc.)
- They store the information either short-term or long-term  
- They process the information
- They provide an output

Modern computers are way different than old computers in size, processing power, and functions among other differnces.

### Binary & Data

Computers do not process the way we see displayed in our monitors.  They process through bits or 1's and 0's known as the binary system.  Computers convert binary into decimals and other characters.  

### CPU, Memory, Input & Output

Input, storage, processing, and output are done by different parts of our computers.  We input information using computer peripherals such as keyboard and mouse.  The computer will store the information either in the short term memory (RAM) or long-term memory (hard disks or other types).  Once the information is stored, the computer will use the CPU, GPU or othertypes of processors to process this information.  The final output will be the visible product that we can either read, see, or hear though our monitors or speakers.
