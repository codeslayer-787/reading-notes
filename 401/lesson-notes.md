### The command line:

The command line is a text based interface to the system.  You receive feedback as you type your commands.  You can navigate through the entire file system just using the command line. 

### Basic navigation:

We have access through the entire file system (as long as we have the right permissions) through the command line.  Commands such as `ls` and `pwd` give us information on what is in the current folder or what's the location of the folder itself in our filesystem.  We can go to a folder using the `cd` command.  The `.` dot references the current folder.  We can jump to the parent folder using the `..` along with `cd`.  Overall, once you practice enough, navigating using the command line is easy and even quicker than using the GUI.

### More about files:

Everything is a file regardless of what OS you are using.  Some common file extensions are `.exe`, `.txt`, and `.png`.  Linux is case sensitive and will see files with uppercase and lowercase differently even if they spell the same thing.  Some folders have hidden files.  You can use the `-a` command when opening a folder to see every single file within.

### Manual Pages

The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available in your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.  You can get manual pages for many commands using `man` followed by the command you want instructions for.

### File manipulation:

You can create and modify files and their names using the command line.  Some common modifications you can make are `mkdir` to create a new folder, `touch` to create a new file.  When using `touch` you need to specify the file extension it is.  You can remove folders as well using `rmdir` or copy them using `cp`.
