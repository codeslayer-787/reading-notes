# Review of lessons learned during 102:

Javascript automatically recognizes numbers...  To add strings, you add '' signs.

|| are called "pipe"  <---- Either or
= is an assignment operator
== this is a comparison operator (compares the value)
=== this is strictly comparative operator  <---- looks at the complete variables.  It compares the data type as well as the value.
&& Both variables need to be true (Booleans)

## HTML

Body - This is where the content on my web page lives.

To start an html document <!DOCTYPE html>

The only two things that are required to do a website are <head> and <body>

A typical website layout will look like:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
    <p></p>
</body>
</html>

<a> <---Anchor tag> (links to external sites)

<a href="whateversite.com">External Site

Inline tags only take the space that it needs.
block section name main li p

Tagging:

element
section
div
p
img
li
class
#id <------ Only used once per page
