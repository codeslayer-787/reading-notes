# Learning updates

Today I learned how to navigate some of the commands to create a file and link Github and my local computer.

I have to remember to navigate back and forth betweeen folders and not get confused on the workspace.  I can use VS Code to update all of my files once I'm in the correct project folder.

## *Git is a Version Control System that allows developers to work on the same project*

Useful commands and steps:

1. git clone ***Insert website here

1. open VS Code with code .

1. Modify Document

1. Save document in VS Code

1. git add ***insert document name

1. git commit -m "insert your comment"

1. git status

1. git push origin main

Remember that the working version on my computer does not become the Head until I commit the changes and push them.

Accronym...  A C P "Add Commit Push"

`mkdir folder1` <---- Creates a folder then I can cd into it and create a file or...
`touch folder1/file1.html` Creates the file in the specified folder as long as it exists.

We can create repositories using git the following way:

- `mkdir target-directory`
- Initialize that folder
- `git init`
- Add Readme and other desired files
- Create a Repo on Github
- Copy clone link
- Add that Repo as remote
- `git remote add origin <url.git>`
- Now we can push our code to the github repo we created.
