# Learning updates

Today I learned how to navigate some of the commands to create a file and link Github and my local computer.

I have to remember to navigate back and forth betweeen folders and not get confused on the workspace.

useful commands:

git clone ***Insert website here
open VS Code with code .
Modify Document
Save document in VS Code
git add ***insert document name
git commit -m "insert your comment"
git status
git push origin main
