# Learning updates

Today I learned how to navigate some of the commands to create a file and link Github and my local computer.

I have to remember to navigate back and forth betweeen folders and not get confused on the workspace.  I can use VS Code to update all of my files once I'm in the correct project folder.

## *Git is a Version Control System that allows developers to work on the same project*

Useful commands and steps:

1. git clone ***Insert website here

1. open VS Code with code .

1. Modify Document

1. Save document in VS Code

1. git add ***insert document name

1. git commit -m "insert your comment"

1. git status

1. git push origin main

Remember that the working version on my computer does not become the Head until I commit the changes and push them.
