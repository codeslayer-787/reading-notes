## Conquering Stage Fright:

Stage fright is a very common occurence.  According to the ADAA article, most of us feel nervous apprehension when preparing to speak up or perform in front of a group.  I find this to be true!  We may feel intense fear or phobia whenever we know we are about to speak in front of a group.  Stage fright seems to do more with our inner world rather than what is happening around us.  This could stem from negative beliefs about yourself, social anxiety disorder, or even low self esteem.  

While the fear of public speaking is very real, we can take steps to overcome our fear.  While we can improve on our speaking skills, that alone is not enough to curb stage fright.  We can learn skills to reduce and manage our fear.  Some techniques are:

- Shift the focus from yourself and your fear to your true purpose.
- Stop thinking that something might go wrong!
- Refuse to think negative thoughts about yourself.
- Practice ways to calm and relax your mind abd body (I.e. deep breathing, relaxation exercises, yoga, and meditation.)
- Exercise, eat well and practice living a healthy lifestyle.
- Visualize your success!
- Make connections with your audience.  You can talk directly to people within your audience.
- Stand up or sit in a self-assured, confident posture.
- Give up trying to be perfect and know that it's OK to make mistakes.

## Mastering Public Speaking:

Now that we've learned about overcoming the fear of public speaking, we should learn some skills about how to be an effective public speaker.  An effective way to up your public speaking game is to use methaphors, smiles, and analogies.  It is a good idea to break down your message into three parts to make it easy to understand.  Using rhetorical questions seems to be an effective way to create a dramatic effect while you're speaking.  

Among some of the techniques discussed in the Science Of People article include having a good warmup routine to get rid of some of the anxiety.  Using a sparkline seems to be a popular way to do public speaking.  A sparkline has the following format:

- What is. - State the problem or current state of affairs.
- Explain what could be.
- Repeat
- End Promise - This is hwo we are fixing the problem

Don't apologize or beg.  A common mistake by many is to apologize or say things such as "That's just my opinion." and such.  This takes away from your credibility.  You should also master your nonverbal behavior.  Smile more, use hand gestures, and use vocal variety.  

We shoud channel our fear whenever we cannot avoid it.  It is natural to have fear when spaking in front of others!  According to studies, it is an evolutionary characteristic.  Speak with passion!!  We can add to our display of passion by working the stage.
