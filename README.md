This is a collection of my readings for Codefellows.

### About Me
My name is Irwin.  I love my family, music, computers, and videogames.  I spend a lot of my free time watching movies (especially horror), trying to figure out how to make my car faster, and (to no avail) trying to convince my son that Fortnite is not the best game ever.

### Growth Minset
***How to stay in a growth minset.***  Here are my 3 examples.

- *Embrace challenges*

- **Adapt and Overcome if there are any setbacks**

- ***Effort is KEY!***

In the words of an unknon phylosopist:
>Git 'er Done!
