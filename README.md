## Description
This is a collection of my readings for Codefellows.

### About Me
My name is Irwin.  I love my family, music, computers, and videogames.  I spend a lot of my free time watching movies (especially horror), trying to figure out how to make my car faster, and (to no avail) trying to convince my son that Fortnite is not the best game ever.  

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico.  We were a poor in money but rich in love kind of family.  My mom bought me my first computer when I was 16 years old and it totally changed my life.  I became very curious about how it worked so knowing that we couldn't afford to break the computer, I went and got a job in a store called CompUSA (I don't think it exists anymore.)  That way I could buy parts and tinker with it both on the hardware and software side.  

My previous coding is from over 15 years ago when I was going for a computer-science degree.  Due to the slow pace of college and what seemed at the time as unnecessary courses, I decided to join the US Air Force.  I completed my BA and MBA degrees and went into the finance world.  While working as a financial advisor, I realized the finance world wasn't for me and started a small business in the Bakken oil field.  Even thought the money was good, I could not stand feeling like I was making the world a worse place to live and being away from my family for extended periods of time.  

COVID-19 gave me the perfect escape plan from the oil fields!  Now that I'm out of the business, I can plan my life the way I want to instead of feeling like things were "pre-ordained" for me.  That is the reason I'm back learning how to do what I really love!

### **Growth Minset**
